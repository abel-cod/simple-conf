#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Iosevka Term
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: +list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. When bold_font or bold_italic_font is set to
#: auto on macOS, the priority of bold fonts is semi-bold, bold,
#: heavy. Setting them manually is useful for font families that have
#: many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic
